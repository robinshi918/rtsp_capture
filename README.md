# rtsp_capture

## purpose
This simple script is to capture from a rtsp stream into a frame periodically. The captured frames are in jpeg format and named with timestamp. 
My initial idea is to capture the frames from my IP camera and make an elapsed stop motion movie.

## how tos
* Open capture_rtsp.py with editor, and edit RTSP_URL with your IP camera's parameter.
* run below command 
  * `python3 capture_rtsp.py`
